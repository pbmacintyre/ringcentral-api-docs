# SMS Quick Start

Welcome to the RingCentral Platform. RingCentral is the leading unified communications platform. From one system developers can integrate with, or build products around all the ways people communicate today: SMS, voice, fax, chat and meetings.

In this Quick Start, we are going to help you send your first SMS on the platform in just a few minutes. Let's get started.

!!! note "Also check out our SMS Best Practices Guide"
    After you finish this quick start, be sure to read our [SMS Best Practices Guide](../sms/best-practices/).

## Create App and Get Credentials

The first thing we need to do is create an app in the RingCentral Developer Portal. This can be done quickly by clicking the "Create SMS App" button below. Just click the button, enter a name and description if you choose, and click the "Create" button. If you do not yet have a RingCentral account, you will be prompted to create one.

<div class="collapse" id="create-app-instructions">
<ol>
<li><a href="https://developer.ringcentral.com/login.html#/">Login or create an account</a> if you have not done so already.</li>
<li>Go to Console/Apps and click 'Create App' button.</li>
<li>Select "API App for RingCentral MVPâ„¢" under "What type of app are you creating?"</li>
<li>Select "Other Non-UI" under "Where will you be calling the API from?"
<li>Select "Only members of my organization/company" under "Who will be authorized to access your app?"
<li>On the second page of the create app wizard, enter your app's name and description. Then select the following permissions:
  <ul>
    <li>SMS</li>
    <li>ReadAccounts</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
<li>We are using Password Flow authentication, so leave "OAuth Redirect URI" blank.</li>
</ol>
</div>

When you are done, you will be taken to the app's dashboard. Make note of the Client ID and Client Secret. We will be using those momentarily.
