# PubNub Notifications JavaScript Quick Start

Welcome to the RingCentral Platform. RingCentral is the leading unified communications platform. From one system developers can integrate with, or build products around all the ways people communicate today: SMS, voice, fax, chat and meetings.

In this Quick Start, we are going to help you subscribe for PubNub push notifications using our Push Notifications API, which allows your application receiving notifications on a selected events. Let's get started.

## Create an App

The first thing we need to do is create an app in the RingCentral Developer Portal. This can be done quickly by clicking the "Create Notifications App" button below. Just click the button, enter a name and description if you choose, and click the "Create" button. If you do not yet have a RingCentral account, you will be prompted to create one.

<a class="btn-link btn-collapse" data-toggle="collapse" href="#create-app-instructions" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="create-app-instructions">Show detailed instructions</a>

<div class="collapse" id="create-app-instructions">
<ol>
<li><a href="https://developer.ringcentral.com/login.html#/">Login or create an account</a> if you have not done so already.</li>
<li>Go to Console/Apps and click 'Create App' button.</li>
<li>Select "API App for RingCentral MVPâ„¢" under "What type of app are you creating?"</li>
<li>Select "Other Non-UI" under "Where will you be calling the API from?"
<li>Select "Only members of my organization/company" under "Who will be authorized to access your app?"
<li>On the second page of the create app wizard, enter your app's name and description. Then select the following permissions:
  <ul>
    <li>SMS</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
<li>We are using Password Flow authentication, so leave "OAuth Redirect URI" blank.</li>
</ol>
</div>

When you are done, you will be taken to the app's dashboard. Make note of the Client ID and Client Secret. We will be using those momentarily.
