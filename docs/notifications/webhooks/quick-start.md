# Webhook Notifications Quick Start

Welcome to the RingCentral Platform. RingCentral is the leading unified communications platform. From one system developers can integrate with, or build products around all the ways people communicate today: SMS, voice, fax, chat and meetings.

In this Quick Start, we are going to help you create a Webhook push notifications app using our Push Notifications API, which allows your application receiving notifications on instant SMS message events. Let's get started.

## Create an App

The first thing we need to do is create an app in the RingCentral Developer Portal. This can be done quickly by clicking the "Create Notifications App" button below. Just click the button, enter a name and description if you choose, and click the "Create" button. If you do not yet have a RingCentral account, you will be prompted to create one.

<a target="_new" href="https://developer.ringcentral.com/new-app?name=Webhook+Notifications+Quick+Start+App&desc=A+simple+app+to+demo+creating+a+webhook+notification+RingCentral&public=false&type=ServerOther&carriers=7710,7310,3420&permissions=SubscriptionWebhook,SMS&redirectUri=&utm_source=devguide&utm_medium=button&utm_campaign=quickstart" class="btn btn-primary">Create Webhook App</a>
<a class="btn-link btn-collapse" data-toggle="collapse" href="#create-app-instructions" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="create-app-instructions">Show detailed instructions</a>

<div class="collapse" id="create-app-instructions">
<ol>
<li><a href="https://developer.ringcentral.com/login.html#/">Login or create an account</a> if you have not done so already.</li>
<li>Go to Console/Apps and click 'Create App' button.</li>
<li>Select "API App for RingCentral MVPâ„¢" under "What type of app are you creating?"</li>
<li>Select "Other Non-UI" under "Where will you be calling the API from?"
<li>Select "Only members of my organization/company" under "Who will be authorized to access your app?"
<li>On the second page of the create app wizard, enter your app's name and description. Then select the following permissions:
  <ul>
    <li>WebhookSubscriptions, SMS</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
<li>We are using Password Flow authentication, so leave "OAuth Redirect URI" blank.</li>
</ol>
</div>

When you are done, you will be taken to the app's dashboard. Make note of the Client ID and Client Secret. We will be using those momentarily.

## Subscribe for push notification

Select your preferred language below.

=== "Javascript"

    ### Install RingCentral JavaScript SDK

    ```bash
    $ npm install ringcentral --save
    ```

    ```

    Copy the forwarding address e.g. https://54a0541a.ngrok.io and append the path "/webhook" to the address then paste it into the DELIVERY_ADDRESS variable in the code below.

    ### Create and Edit webhook-notification.js

    Create a file called <tt>webhook-notification.js</tt>. Be sure to edit the variables in ALL CAPS with your app and user credentials. Be sure to also set the recipient's phone number.

    ```javascript
    {!> code-samples/webhooks/quick-start/javascript/webhook-notification.js !}
    ```

    ### Create a WebHookServer

    We use Jetty embedded for our server. You can get it [here](https://www.eclipse.org/jetty/documentation/current/advanced-embedding.html).

    Browse to the `WebHook` project folder and create a WebHookServer project

    ```
    $ cd WebHook
    $ curl -o jetty-all-uber.jar https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/eclipse/jetty/aggregate/jetty-all/9.4.19.v20190610/jetty-all-9.4.19.v20190610-uber.jar
    $ touch WebhookServer.java
    $ open WebhookServer.java
    ```

    Edit the `WebhookServer.java` with code below:

    ```Java
    {!> code-samples/webhooks/quick-start/java/WebhookServer.java !} 
    ```

    ### Build and run the WebHook Server

    ```bash
    $ mkdir classes
    $ javac -d classes -cp jetty-all-uber.jar WebHookServer.java
    $ java -cp classes:jetty-all-uber.jar com.ringcentral.WebHookServer
    ```

    Now run the SubscribeForWebHookNotification app from Eclipse.

    Send an sms to `RINGCENTRAL_USERNAME` phone number, and watch the output on the WebHookServer terminal window.

=== "C#"

    We use .NET core which is cross-platform. You can get it [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).

    ### Create a solution

    ```bash
    mkdir webhook-demo
    cd my-solution
    dotnet new sln
    ```

    ### Create WebHook Server project

    ```
    cd webhook-demo
    mkdir webhook-server
    cd webhook-server
    dotnet new web
    cd ..
    dotnet sln add ./webhook-server/webhook-server.csproj
    cd webhook-server
    ```

    Edit `Startup.cs` and override its content with code below:

    ```c#
    {!> code-samples/webhooks/quick-start/c-sharp/Startup.cs !} 
    ```

    ### Run ngrok to create a localhost tunnel

    ```bash
    $ ngrok http 5000
    ```

    Copy the forwarding address e.g. https://54a0541a.ngrok.io and append the path "/webhook" to the address then paste it into the `DELIVERY_ADDRESS` variable in the code below.

    ### Create Setup WebHook project

    cd my-solution
    mkdir setup-webhook
    cd setup-webhook
    dotnet new console
    cd ..
    dotnet sln add ./setup-webhook/setup-webhook.csproj
    cd setup-webhook
    dotnet add package RingCentral.Net
    ```

    Edit `setup-webhook.csproj` file and add `<LangVersion>latest</LangVersion>` to `<PropertyGroup>`.

    Edit `Program.cs` file and override its content with code below. Be sure to edit the variables in <ALL CAPS> with your app credentials.

    ```c#
    {!> code-samples/webhooks/quick-start/c-sharp/Program.cs !} 
    ```

    ### Run Your Code

    You are almost done. Now run your script.

    ```ruby
    {!> code-samples/webhooks/quick-start/ruby/webhook-server.rb !} 
    ```

    ### Run Your Code

    You are almost done. Now run your script.

    Open a terminal window and run the server code.

    ```bask
    $ ruby webhook-server.rb
    ```

    Open another terminal window and run the app

    ```bask
    $ ruby webhook-notification.rb
    ```

    Now you can send an SMS message to the extension's phone number to see how you'll receive the notification.

## Graduate Your App

Congratulations on creating your first RingCentral application. The last step is to graduate your application. We recommend [going through this process](../../../basics/production) for your first application so you can understand the steps to take in the future, but also to come to appreciate the care taken by RingCentral to ensure that only high-quality apps are allowed into our production environment.
